Hi there !

I'm an indie Italian Chemistry Majoring in Milan University, passionate about technology, building my version of the (digital) word one step at time.

The small projects you find here are usually built for my needs: I share them here so that maybe someone can get inspired in some configuration especially regarding dotfiles and other software config.
